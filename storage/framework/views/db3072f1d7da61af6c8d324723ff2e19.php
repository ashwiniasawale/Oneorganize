                <p><strong>Post-Employment NON-COMPETITION Agreement </strong></p>
                <p>Employee understand that during his / her employment by the Company Employee may become Employee
                    familiar with confidential information of the Company. Therefore, it is possible that Employee could
                    gravely harm the Company if Employee worked for a competitor. Accordingly, Employee agrees for <b> 2
                        years</b> following the end of his / her employment with the Company not to compete, directly or
                    indirectly, with the Company in any of its business if the duties of such competitive employment
                    inherently require that Employee use or disclose any of the Company's confidential information.
                    Competition includes the design, development, production, promotion or sale of products or services
                    competitive with those of the Company. Employee agrees not to engage in, or contribute his / her
                    knowledge to, any work that is competitive with or functionally similar to a product, process,
                    apparatus or service on which Employee worked while at the Company. The following post-employment
                    non-competition terms shall apply also: <br> <b>Diversion of Company Business: </b>For a period of
                    <b>2 years </b> from the date his / her employment ends, Employee will not divert or attempt to
                    divert from the Company any business the Company enjoyed or solicited from its customers prior to
                    the termination of his / her employment.
